# V4 Ai Web Search Research Guide - v4.6.0-real

This guide is updated for v4.6.0-real and preserves the v4.5 safety boundaries while adding opportunity-review workflow context.


## v4.6 Scope

v4.6.0-real adds the Opportunity Review Workbench, Market Detail / Opportunity Review pages, Market Family Comparison pages, AI Edge Packet Lifecycle summaries, operator notes/review records, safe watchlist and paper-review queue states, visual QA hardening, route smoke hardening, and no-live-mutation validation.

## Review-Only Boundary

All opportunity review records, operator notes, watchlist states, paper-review queue states, market-edge recommendations, AI Edge packets, calibration summaries, and evidence reviews are research/review-only. They do not approve trades, place orders, cancel orders, arm live trading, disable read-only mode, disable the kill switch, or bypass backend gates.

## Key Routes

- `/v3/opportunities` and `/opportunities` — Opportunity Review Workbench.
- `/v3/markets/{market_id_or_slug}` and `/market/{market_id_or_slug}` — Market Detail / Opportunity Review.
- `/v3/markets/family/{family_id}` — Market Family Comparison.
- `/v3/ai/edge/packets` — AI Edge packet list and lifecycle context.
- `/api/v3/opportunities/reviews` — review record list.
- `/api/v3/opportunities/review/{market_id_or_slug}/notes` — operator notes update API.
- `/api/v3/opportunities/review/{market_id_or_slug}/status` — review status update API.

## Favorite vs Edge

Favorite means most likely outcome in a detected market family. Edge means possible model-fair versus market-implied price mismatch. A favorite can have no edge, and an underdog can have draft edge. This distinction is displayed in the workbench, detail pages, and family comparison pages.

## Safety Confirmations

- No real order placement.
- No real order cancellation.
- No AI trade approval.
- No automatic live trading arming.
- No hidden autonomous trading.
- No release ZIP runtime ledgers, credentials, AI responses, operator notes, review records, watchlists, paper-review queues, screenshots with secrets, local logs, `.env`, venvs, or node modules.

## Preserved Prior Guidance

# AI Web Search Research Guide - v4.6.0-real

OpenAI web search remains an optional research-packet input, not an execution signal. Packaged defaults disable web search and require explicit operator configuration.

## Defaults

- `AI_EDGE_ALLOW_WEB_SEARCH=false`
- `OPENAI_ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=false`
- `OPENAI_API_ENABLE=false`
- `OPENAI_DRY_RUN_ONLY=true`
- `AI_EDGE_DRY_RUN_ONLY=true`
- `AI_EDGE_REQUIRE_OPERATOR_APPROVAL=true`

When enabled by the operator, web search may support source discovery, source quality notes, recency checks, contradiction tracking, and missing-information lists. It does not place orders, approve trades, disable safety gates, or make model fair probabilities objective truth.


## AI and Web Search Limits

OpenAI web search is disabled by default and can only be used for explicit research packet workflows when configured by the operator. Local LLMs such as Qwen through Ollama do not natively browse the web in this app; they can review app-provided evidence packets only. AI Edge packet output remains draft/review-only and does not become an accepted task, trade, order, or approval without explicit human action in the appropriate safe workflow.


## Safety and Scope

All edge, AI Edge, evidence, calibration, family-ranking, and recommendation output is draft research only. It is not financial advice, not a trade approval, and not an executable order. The release does not place orders, cancel orders, arm live trading, disable read-only mode, disable the kill switch, or let AI bypass backend gates. Live controls, paper controls, approval checkboxes, typed confirmation phrases, warning acknowledgements, audit logging, emergency controls, and kill-switch controls remain authoritative.
